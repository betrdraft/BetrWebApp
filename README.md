# BetrWebApp
This is the Betr Draft front-end

It's written in AngularJS with some JQuery libraries

TODO
-Wallet page implemented
-Team builder page implemented
-Current contest statistics(What place they are in, how many points their players have in that contest, etc)
-Implement pages to be mobile friendly

I'm sure there's more that I'm forgetting.
